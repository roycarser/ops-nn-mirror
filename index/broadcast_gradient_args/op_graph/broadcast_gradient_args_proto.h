* @par Inputs
* @li x1: A tensor. The type support int32 and int64. Its shape must be 1D. Format: ND.
* @li x2: A tensor. Its type is consistent with x1. Its shape must be 1D. Format: ND.

* @par Outputs
* @li y1: A tensor. Reduction indices of x1. Its type is consistent with x1. Its shape must be 1D. Format: ND.
* @li y2: A tensor. Reduction indices of x2. Its type is consistent with x1. Its shape must be 1D. Format: ND.

* @par Third-party framework compatibility
* Compatible with the TensorFlow operator BroadcastGradientArgs.

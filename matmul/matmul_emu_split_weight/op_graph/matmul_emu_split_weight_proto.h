/**
* @brief Performs dual-path BF16 GEMM fusion to simulate FP32 precision matrix multiplication.
* The FP32 weight is split offline into a high-bit BF16 weight and a low-bit residual BF16 weight.
* At inference time, two BF16 GEMMs are executed and linearly combined. \n
*
* @par Inputs:
* @li x: A tensor. Activation matrix.
* The types supports bfloat16. The format supports ND.
* @li w_high: A tensor. High-bit weight, obtained by truncating FP32 weight to BF16.
* The types supports bfloat16. Has the same type as input "x".
* The format supports ND.
* @li w_low: A tensor. Low-bit residual weight, obtained by dividing the residual by scale and truncating to BF16.
* Must be one of the following types: bfloat16. Has the same type as input "x".
* The shape must be identical to w_high. The format supports ND. \n
*
* @par Outputs:
 * @li y: A tensor. Output matrix.
 * The types supports float32. The format supports ND. \n
*
* @par Attributes:
* @li w_low_scale: A required float. Scale factor for the low-bit residual weight. Defaults to 0.00390625 (1/256). \n
* @li transpose_x: An optional bool. Specifies whether to transpose input x. Defaults to false. \n
* @li transpose_w: An optional bool. Specifies whether to transpose weights w_high/w_low. Defaults to false. \n
* @li y_dtype: A required int. Specifies the output data type of y. 0 for FP32. Defaults to 0. \n

 * | x     | w_high | w_low | y      |
 * |-------|--------|-------|--------|
 * | BF16  | BF16   | BF16  | FLOAT  |

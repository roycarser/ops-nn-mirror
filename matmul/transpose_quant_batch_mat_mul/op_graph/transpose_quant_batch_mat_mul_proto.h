/**
* @brief Multiplies matrix "a" by matrix "b", producing "a @ b". \n
* @par Inputs:
* Five inputs, including:
* @li x1: A matrix tensor. Must be one of the following types:
* float8_e4m3fn, float8_e5m2. 3D. Has format ND.
* @li x2: A matrix tensor. Must be one of the following types:
* float8_e4m3fn, float8_e5m2. 3D. Has format ND.
* @li bias: An optional tensor. Bias for batchmatmul. Must be one of the following types:
* float32, float16, bfloat16. 1D. Has format ND.
* @li x1_scale: A matrix tensor, quantization parameter.
             Must be one of the following types: float32、float8_e8m0. The format
             supports ND. The shape is 1D (t,), with t equal to m, where m is the same as that of x1.
* @li x2_scale: A matrix tensor, quantization parameter.
             Must be one of the following types: float32、float8_e8m0. The format
             supports ND. The shape is 1D (t,), with t equal to n, where n is the same as that of x2.

* @par Attributes:
* Six attributes, including:
* @li dtype: An int. Declare the output type, supports  1(float16), 27(bfloat16). Default: 1(float16).
* @li group_size: An optional int. Indicating the ratio between x1_scale/x2_scale and x1/x2 in group dequantization. Default to be 0.
* @li perm_x1: A list int. "x1" is permuted to shape [B, M, K] before multiplication, the default value is [1, 0, 2].
* @li perm_x2: A list int. "x2" is permuted to shape [B, K, N] before multiplication, the default value is [0, 1, 2].
* @li perm_y: A list int. "y" is permuted after multiplication, the default value is [1, 0, 2].
* @li batch_split_factor: An optional int. Declares factor of output_batch. Default to be 1.

* @par Outputs:
* One output, including:
* y: A matrix Tensor. Must be one of the following types: float16, bfloat16. 
  The format supports ND. The shape dim must be 3D. \n

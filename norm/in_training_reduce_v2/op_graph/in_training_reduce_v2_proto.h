/**
* @brief InstanceNorm training-forward reduce stage, paired with INTrainingUpdateV2.
* For each instance-channel (n, c), reduces over the spatial axes (H, W for 4D NCHW;
* D, H, W for 5D NCDHW) and outputs the raw sum (sum = Sigma x) and squared sum
* (square_sum = Sigma x^2). The reduction keeps N and C; outputs are raw sums
 * (no division by R, no affine). fp16 inputs are promoted to fp32 for
 * accumulation, and the outputs are always fp32.

* @par Inputs:
* One input:
* @li x: Empty tensors are NOT supported: every axis, including the reduction
*        (spatial) axes, must be positive. A zero-sized reduction axis is rejected at
*        tiling time (the REDUCE_EMPTY template that would write the all-zero
*        [N, C, 1, ...] outputs is not part of this iteration). Must be one of the
 *        following types: float16, float32. 4D with format NCHW, 5D with
*        format NCDHW, or 2D~8D with format ND (the second dim is fixed as dim C).

* @par Outputs:
* Two outputs:
* @li sum: An ND tensor of dtype float32. The number of dims is same as input x,
*          dim N and dim C are same as input x, the reduction axes are 1.
* @li square_sum: An ND tensor of the same dtype (float32) and shape as output sum.

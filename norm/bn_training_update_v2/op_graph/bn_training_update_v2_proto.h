* @brief Performs reduced batch normalization. For some scenes which don't
* contain assign moving average .

* @par Inputs:
* Five inputs, including:
* @li x: A 4D tensor of type float16/float32/bfloat16, with format NHWC or NCHW. Empty tensors are not supported.
* Input tensor, that is, the original data that needs to be normalized.
* @li sum: A 1D tensor of type float32, the shape is same as dim C of input "x", for the output of operator
BNTrainingReduce.
* It represents the sum of the input tensor "x" on the C axis. Has the same format as "x".
* @li square_sum: A 1D tensor of type float32, the shape is same as dim C of input "x", for the output of operator
BNTrainingReduce.
* It represents the sum of squares of the input tensor "x" on the C axis. Has the same format as "x".
* @li scale: A 1D tensor of type float32, the shape is same as dim C of input "x", for the scaling factor. Has the same
format as "x".
* @li offset: A 1D tensor of type float32, the shape is same as dim C of input "x", for the scaling offset. Has the same
format as "x". \n

* @par Attributes:
* epsilon: A required float32, specifying the small value added to variance
* to avoid dividing by zero. \n

* @par Outputs:
* Three outputs, including:
* @li y: A 4D tensor of type float16 or float32 or bfloat16, for normalized "x". Empty tensors are not supported.
* Has the same dype, format and shape as "x".
* @li batch_mean: A 1D tensor of type float32, for the mean of "x". shape must be C channel. Has the same format as "x".
* @li batch_variance: A 1D tensor of type float32, for the variance of "x" . shape must be C channel. Has the same
format as "x". \n

* @attention Constraints:
* @li This operator is used in conjunction with BNTrainingReduce.
* @li For Atlas 200/300/500 Inference Product, the result accuracy fails to reach 1/1000 due to
* the square root instruction.

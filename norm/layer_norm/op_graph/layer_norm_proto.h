*@brief Layernorm operator interface implementation \n
*  calculating: x, gamma, beta \n
*  mean  = np.mean(x, reduce_axis, keepdims=True) \n
*  variance = np.mean(np.power((x - mean),2), reduce_axis, keepdims=True) \n
*  y = gamma*((x - mean) / np.sqrt(variance + epsilon)) + beta

*@par Inputs
*Three inputs, including:
* @li x: A ND Tensor. Must be one of the following dtypes: float16, float32, bfloat16.
* The shape is [A1,...,Ai,R1,...,Rj].
* @li gamma: A ND Tensor. Must be one of the following dtypes: float16, float32, bfloat16.
* Has the same dtype and shape as beta. The shape is [R1,...,Rj].
* @li beta: A ND Tensor. Must be one of the following dtypes: float16, float32, bfloat16.
* Has the same dtype and shape as gamma. The shape is [R1,...,Rj]. \n

*@par Attributes
* @li begin_norm_axis: An optional attribute, the dtype is int32. Defaults to 0.
* Indicates the index of the R1 axis in the shape of x.
* @li begin_params_axis: An optional attribute, the dtype is int32. Defaults to 0.
* In Ascend 950 AI Processor, begin_params_axis and begin_norm_axis refer to the same axis in the shape of x.
* @li epsilon: An optional attribute, the dtype is float32. Defaults to 1e-7 . \n

*@par Outputs
*Three outputs, including:
* @li y: A ND Tensor. Must be one of the following dtypes: float16, float32, bfloat16.
* Has the same dtype, shape and format as x. 
* @li mean: A ND Tensor. Must be one of the following dtypes: float16, float32, bfloat16.
* Has the same shape as variance, which is [A1,...,Ai,1,...,1], where there are j 1's after Ai.
* @li variance: A ND Tensor. Must be one of the following dtypes: float16, float32, bfloat16.
* Has the same shape as mean, which is [A1,...,Ai,1,...,1], where there are j 1's after Ai.

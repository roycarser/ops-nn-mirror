*@brief part of SyncBatchNormBackward .

*@par Inputs:
* Four inputs, including:
*@li sum_dy: A ND tensor. Represents the sum of the gradients of the loss function output to the batch normalization layer.
* Must be one of the following types: float16, float32, bfloat16.
*@li sum_dy_dx_pad: A ND tensor. Represents the sum of the gradients of the input of the loss function to the batch normalization layer.
* Must be one of the following types: float16, float32, bfloat16. Has the same type, shape and format as "sum_dy".
*@li mean: A ND tensor. The mean value of the input data calculated during forward propagation.
* Must be one of the following types: float16, float32, bfloat16. Has the same type, shape and format as "sum_dy".
*@li invert_std: A ND tensor. The reciprocal of the input data standard deviation calculated during forward propagation.
* Must be one of the following types: float16, float32, bfloat16. Has the same type, shape and format as "sum_dy". \n

*@par Outputs:
*@li sum_dy_xmu: A ND tensor. Represents the sum of the gradients of the loss function against the mean.
* Has the same type, shape and format as "sum_dy".
*@li y: A ND tensor. Indicates the adjusted gradient, which is used for backpropagation to the previous layer.
* Has the same type, shape and format as "sum_dy". \n

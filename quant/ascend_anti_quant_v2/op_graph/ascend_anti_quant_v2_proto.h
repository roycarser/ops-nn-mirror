/**
* @brief Anti quantizes the input. \n 

* @par Inputs:
* @li x: A required Tensor. Must be one of the following types: int8, int4, hifloat8, float8_e5m2, float8_e4m3. 
* The format support ND. Shape support 1D ~ 8D. Specifying the input.
* @li scale: A required Tensor. Must be one of the following types: float32, bfloat16.
* The format support ND. Shape support 1D ~ 8D. Specifying the scaling ratio.
* @li offset: An optional Tensor. Must be one of the following types: float32, bfloat16.
* The format support ND. Shape support 1D ~ 8D. Shape and dataType is same as "scale". Specifying the offset. \n

* @par Attributes:
* @li dst_type: A optional int32, specifying the output data type. Defaults to "DT_FLOAT16".
* @li sqrt_mode: A optional bool, specifying whether to perform square root on "scale", either "true" or "false".
* Defaults to "false" . \n

* @attention Constraints:
* @li When dst_type of x is DT_INT4, the last axis of its shape is even.
# @li When the data type of x is DT_HIFLOAT8, DT_FLOAT8_E5M2, or DT_FLOAT8_E4M3, scale is only supported for DT_FLOAT.
# @li When the data type of x is DT_HIFLOAT8, DT_FLOAT8_E5M2, or DT_FLOAT8_E4M3, sqrt_mode must be "false". 
* @li The dimensionality of scale must match that of x, or be 1-dimensional. The shape of scale must satisfy the following constraints: \n
* - If x is 1-dim, the shape of scale must be [1] or the same as x.
* - If scale is 1-dim, its size must be either 1, x[-1] or x[-2].
# - If scale is multi-dim, it can have at most one non-d dimension, and that dimension must be along the -1st or -2nd axis of x.

* @par Outputs:
* y: The dequantized output tensor of type float16 or bfloat16. The format support ND.
* Shape support 1D ~ 8D. Has the same shape as input "x". Dtype should be the same as the attribute dst_type. \n
